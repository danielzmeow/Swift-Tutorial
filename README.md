# Swift Tutorial

This repository contains the notes and codes I've compiled while progressing through my learning journey of Swift and SwiftUI.

# Develop in Swift

## Chapter I: Explore Xcode

In Swift, the `String` type is used to denote text. **Modifiers** applied consequences to this type can ultimately impact how the UI appears in a real application.

```Swift
//With padding
Text("Hello, World!")
    .padding()
    .background(Color.green, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 6))
//Without padding
Text("Hello, World!")
    .background(Color.green, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 6))
    .padding()
```

## Chapter II: Views, structures, and properties

### Create a subview

```java 
struct SubView: View {
    var body: some View {
        [View Contents]
    }
}
```

### Add a property

You can incorporate a property using the format `let [name]: [Type]`, which allows you to pass this property into the subviews seamlessly.

## Chapter III: Layout and style

In Xcode, incorporating a new SwiftUI View is straightforward; just navigate to File > New > File from Template.

The `.font` modifier, which demands a **Font** type argument, allows shorthand notationâ€”`Font.title` can be succinctly written as `.title`.

Ensure that when utilizing `#Preview`, the logic aligns with your invocation method. The description should be sufficiently extensive to span multiple lines, for example, *A multiline description about a feature paired with the image on the left.*

### Size of Views

To add borders to UI views, employ the `.border` attribute. Meanwhile, `.frame` is intended to constrain view dimensions. Use `.tint` to deploy the App's accent color.

### Padding

To instantiate padding surrounding views, utilize `.padding`.

Integrate `Spacer()` to occupy additional space, ensuring the page is fully utilized.

### Tab View

Craft a tab view using the tab view interface.

```Swift
TabView {
    WelcomePage()
    FeaturePage()
}
.tabViewStyle(.page)
```

### Customize Color in Assets

Focus on the following aspects:

- Opacity
- Brightness
- Gradient

## Chapter IV: Buttons and state

`@State` properties and buttons can work together to update the UI of app.
